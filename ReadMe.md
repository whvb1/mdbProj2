this is a simple pokedex. it takes in the users filter preferences (name, min attack, min defense, and types) and takes the user to an activity displaying the relevent pokemen. the pokemen are taken parsed in from a local JSON file, and the images are displayed using glide. Finally, there is an info button on each pokemon that allows the user to see more detailed information, and in the information, takes the user to the pokemon.com link of that pokemon
